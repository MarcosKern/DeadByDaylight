        <p>The Bloodweb is the Character Progression mechanic of Dead by Daylight and allows Players to purchase various Unlockables in exchange for the bloodpoints gained from playing ranked Trials.</p>
        <p>The Bloodweb is constructed from three concentric circles around a central Node with interconnecting lines that connect a random number of Nodes, located on the circles, together.</p>
        <p>The number of Nodes in a given Bloodweb depend on the Character's current Level, with higher levels producing larger Bloodwebs with more interconnections.</p>
